 About

ScriptLoader is a simple JavaScript loader utility API which downloads scripts 
in parallel with other resources along with maintaining execution order. 

The parallelism is achieved using the script DOM element technique (i.e. 
creating dynamic scripts and inserting them in DOM) and for execution order
a code massaging build time step is needed. 

The extra step is to wrap the entire JS code (for which execution order should
be maintained) in a wrapper function and passing that function in the API, as
shown below

var wrappedFn = function () {
	// All the application JS code
};

loadScript([
	{ url:  'one.js', delayedExec:  false }, 
	{ url:  'two.js', delayedExec:  'wrappedFn' }
], function () {
	// Callback function
});
